/// # Multiple consumers
///
/// You may have noticed this structure can be used simultaneously by multiple threads. If it is

/// but it is not broadcasted to all of them.
///
/// If you need multiple recipients, you can create multiple independent instances (not by cloning,
/// but by the constructor).

/// # extern crate signal_hook;
